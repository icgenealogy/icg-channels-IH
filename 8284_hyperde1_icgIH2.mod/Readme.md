## Description

This is a single channel model file that was originally part of a [published model on the ModelDB website](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=8284).


The file [8284\_hyperde1.mod](8284_hyperde1_icgIH2.mod) was extrated from [the ModelDB repository](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=8284), and committed as 8284\_hyperde1\_icgIH2.mod.

The current version of the file was modified slighly for automatic evaluation by the [icg-nrn-sim](https://github.com/icgenealogy/icg-nrn-sim) tool. To find the original please check the git history.

Since the original channel model *[8284\_hyperde1.mod](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=8284)* contained several ionic currents, for the derived channel *8284\_hyperde1\_icgIH2.mod* we deactivated all currents except for one single remaining current.
